# Dutch National Flag

==Example==: sort the array , containing only 0's , 1's & 2's 

1. Initialize three pointers : l->0th index , m->0th index , h-> `(n-1)th` index
2. The elements between m and h are unsorted so we need to traverse between m and h.
3. if `arr[m] == 0 ` --> swap m and l , increment m and l by one position . 
4. if `arr[m] == 1` --> keep it there and increment m by one position .
5. if `arr[m] == 2` --> swap m and h , and decrement h by one . 


### ðŸ•’ Time & Space Complexity

- **Time**: `O(n)` â€“ one pass.
    
- **Space**: `O(1)` â€“ in-place sorting.


# Collections Frameworks

| List        | Set           | Map           |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| *ArrayList* | *HashSet*     | *HashMap*     |
| LinkedList  | LinkedHashSet | LinkedHashMap |
| Vector      | TreeSet       | TreeMap       |

List , Set and Map , these are interfaces .
Rest of the terms are all classes .
Interface contains , incomplete methods , Class contains complete methods .

List is ordered , which can allow duplicates .
Set is unordered , it doesn't accept duplicates .
Maps Contains , key-value pairs.
